<p><strong>Information Technology/Business Analyst (BS)</strong></p>

<p>I am currently enrolled at Mount Aloysius College for Information Technology. I am originally from Lancaster Pennsylvania
   and wanted to stay in Pennsylvania for education. I have always enjoyed working with computers and technology in general
   so IT was a great fit. The fact that technology is always evolving each and every day, keeps me involved at all times!</p>
